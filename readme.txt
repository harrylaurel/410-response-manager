== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is a 410 Gone response? =

A 410 Gone response indicates that the requested resource has been intentionally and permanently removed. Unlike a 404 Not Found, it explicitly tells search engines that the content will never return, helping with faster index cleanup.

= Can I use regular expressions? =

Yes! Enable the "Use as Regular Expression" option when adding URL patterns. This allows for flexible pattern matching like:
* `^/old-products/.*` - Match all URLs starting with /old-products/
* `/discontinued-\d+` - Match URLs containing 'discontinued-' followed by numbers

= How do I bulk import URLs? =

1. Prepare a CSV file with two columns: URL pattern and is_regex (0 or 1)
2. Use the CSV Upload tab in the admin interface
3. Select your file and click Upload
4. The plugin will validate and import valid patterns

= Is it cache-friendly? =

Yes, the plugin implements WordPress caching for optimal performance. URL patterns are cached and only refreshed when necessary.

* All data is properly sanitized and validated
